 *
 * A `blender::Stack<T>` is a dynamically growing FILO (first-in, last-out) data structure. It is
 * designed to be a more convenient and efficient replacement for `std::stack`.
 *
 * The improved efficiency is mainly achieved by supporting small buffer optimization. As long as
 * the number of elements added to the stack stays below InlineBufferCapacity, no heap allocation
 * is done. Consequently, values stored in the stack have to be movable and they might be moved,
 * when the stack is moved.
 *
 * A Vector can be used to emulate a stack. However, this stack implementation is more efficient
 * when all you have to do is to push and pop elements. That is because a vector guarantees that
 * all elements are in a contiguous array. Therefore, it has to copy all elements to a new buffer
 * when it grows. This stack implementation does not have to copy all previously pushed elements
 * when it grows.
 *
 * blender::Stack is implemented using a double linked list of chunks. Each chunk contains an array
 * of elements. The chunk size increases exponentially with every new chunk that is required. The
 * lowest chunk, i.e. the one that is used for the first few pushed elements, is embedded into the
 * stack.
